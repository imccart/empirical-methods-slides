## Background

1. What percent of people are uninsured?

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat <- read_tsv("../data/acs_medicaid.txt")

ins.dat <- ins.dat %>%
  mutate(perc_private = (ins_employer + ins_direct)/adult_pop,
         perc_public = (ins_medicare + ins_medicaid)/adult_pop,
         perc_ins = (adult_pop - uninsured)/adult_pop,
         perc_unins = uninsured/adult_pop,
         perc_employer = ins_employer/adult_pop,
         perc_medicaid = ins_medicaid/adult_pop,
         perc_medicare = ins_medicare/adult_pop,
         perc_direct = ins_direct/adult_pop)

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_unins)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction Uninsured",
    title="Share of Uninsured over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```

## Background

1. What percent of people are uninsured?

2. How do people get health insurance?

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>%
  filter(year==2012) %>% pivot_longer(c("perc_employer","perc_direct","perc_medicaid")) %>%
  select(State, name, value) %>%
  group_by(name) %>% summarize(mean=mean(value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=name, y=mean)) +
  geom_col() + ylim(0,0.65) + 
  labs(
    x="Source of Insurance",
    y="Percent",
    title="Source of Health Insurance in 2012"
  ) + theme_bw() + scale_x_discrete(labels=c('perc_direct'='Direct Purchase',
                                             'perc_employer'='Employer-provided',
                                             'perc_medicaid'='Medicaid'))
```

## Employer provided insurance

The U.S. still relies heavily on private insurance provided by employers. 

::: {.fragment}
Any thoughts on why?
:::

---

## Employer provided insurance

1. Stabalization act of 1942 (wages frozen but not benefits)

2. Tax exclusion for insurance expenditures (1954)

---

## How did the ACA change things?

- Create health insurance exchanges
    - Individual mandate (since set to $0)
    - Premium and cost-sharing subsidies (some unpaid by Trump administration)
    - Insurance subsidies (removed before intended)
    - Decision assistance
    - Minimum benefits and community ratings
- Stay on parent's plan to 26

---

## How did the ACA change things?

- Medicaid Expansion
    - Originally tied to federal funding
    - Made voluntary by supreme court ruling
    - Higher initial federal match rate, decreasing over time
- Pay-for-performance measures
    - Hospital value-based purchasing
    - Hospital readmission reduction
    - Medicare Advantage quality improvement program
    - Bundled payments and ACOs (related)

## Change in Insurance Type over Time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

## Count of plans by type (across years)
mean.dat <- ins.dat %>%
  pivot_longer(c("perc_employer","perc_direct","perc_medicaid", "perc_medicare")) %>%
  select(State, name, value, year) %>%
  group_by(name, year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(value)) %>% ungroup()

mean.dat <- mean.dat %>%
  mutate(name = as.factor(name)) %>%
  mutate(name = fct_recode(name,
                           "Direct Purchase" = "perc_direct",
                           "Employer-provided" = "perc_employer",
                           "Medicaid" = "perc_medicaid",
                           "Medicare" = "perc_medicare"))

plot_ly(mean.dat,
        y=~name, 
        x=~mean, 
        frame=~as.factor(year), 
        type='bar',
        width=800,
        height=400) %>%
  animation_slider(
    currentvalue = list(prefix = "Year ", font = list(color="blue"))
  ) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Fraction of Population"), 
         yaxis = list(title = ""))
```


# Data for this (final!) homework assignment

---

## Data sources

We'll use two main data sources here:

1. Data on which states expanded Medicaid (and when
 - Available from *Kaiser Family Foundation*

2. Data on insurance status and source of health insurance by state
 - Available from the *American Community Survey*
 - These data can be tricky to work with due to their size, but there are some handy tricks in `R`

---

## Data sources

Code and links available at the [Insurance Access GitHub repository](https://github.com/imccart-test/insurance-access)

---

## Medicaid Expansion

- Directly downloaded from KFF website
- Just a raw .csv file

---

## Insurance status and source

- Data from the American Community Survey
- CPS data also available but questions changed in 2014
- Easiest way to access ACS data is through a Census API and the `acs` package...details on the *GitHub* repo

---

## What is an API?

- Stands for application programming interface
- An official way for one computer to request information from another
- Often requires a code for external program/server to validate the request



---

## Describing the data

First let's take a look at the final dataset
```{r}
head(ins.dat %>% arrange(year, State))
```

---

## Summary stats

And now for some basic summary stats (pooling all years):

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

sum.vars <- ins.dat %>% select('Uninsured'=perc_unins, 'Direct Purchase'=perc_direct, 'Medicaid'=perc_medicaid)

datasummary(All(sum.vars) ~ Mean + SD + Histogram, data=sum.vars)
```

---

## Uninsurance over time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_unins)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction Uninsured",
    title="Share of Uninsured over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```


---

## Direct purchase over time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_direct)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction with Direct Purchase",
    title="Share of Direct Purchase Insurance over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```


---

## Medicaid over time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_medicaid)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction with Medicaid",
    title="Share of Medicaid Insurance over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```


---

## Main takeaways

1. Large reduction in uninsured population following ACA
2. Biggest gains going to direct purchase (exchanges) and Medicaid (expansion)

::: {.fragment}
But what amount of extra insurance is *due to* Medicaid expansion? In other words, who got insurance through Medicaid that wouldn't have gotten it otherwise?
:::

## What does the literature say

The *Kaiser Family Foundation* has some great info on this...

- [KFF Medicaid Coverage](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/)
- [KFF Report on ACA Expansion](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-under-the-aca-updated-findings-from-a-literature-review-august-2019/)
- [Health Insurance and Mortality](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26533) (not what we're discussing here but still important)
