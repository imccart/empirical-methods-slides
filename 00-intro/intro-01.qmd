## Motivating question

**Does health care spending improve health?**

Let's motivate the course with this simple question...does health care spending improve our health?

       y = "Mortality Rate",

## Spending and Health

- Does medical spending make us sicker?
- What else might explain this relationship?

## Goals of this course.

1. Understand and implement selected methods for causal inference
2. Along the way...data management and version control with real data
3. Summarize, visualize, and explain research results


# Syllabus highlights

## Why this course?

1. Major problems that need solutions
2. Need good, convincing empirical work for policy
3. Working with data is hard, particularly health care data
4. Your work should be transparent and reproducible
